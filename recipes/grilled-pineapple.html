    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><em>Grilled pineapple</em> is so easy and really good. Hot sauce gives it an extra kick and cuts the sweetness. Serve these as snacks while the rest of the grilled feast comes together but be warned, they go quickly!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and cut into 1-inch rings</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>Â¼ teaspoon honey</li>
            <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place pineapple rings in a large resealable plastic bag. Add butter, honey, hot pepper sauce, and salt.</li>
            <li>Seal the bag and shake to coat evenly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight.</li>
